  - name: Michael Scott
    role: Regional Manager
    team: Sales
    location: Scranton Branch
    qa:
      - question: What are your primary responsibilities?
        answer: >
          I lead the Scranton branch, set sales targets, coach the sales team, and ensure we
          hit quarterly revenue goals while keeping morale high. I also own territory design,
          hiring decisions in partnership with HR, quarterly planning with Finance, and the
          executive relationship with our top 10 accounts in the region.
      - question: Which projects are you focused on right now?
        answer: >
          I am driving a key account growth initiative for regional clients, a referral
          program to expand into local small businesses, and a hygiene project to improve CRM
          data quality and stage hygiene. We are also piloting a light-weight MEDDICC
          qualification to improve forecast accuracy.
      - question: Describe your day-to-day workflow.
        answer: >
          I start with a quick floor walk to check energy, then review the pipeline and
          forecast, identify stuck deals, and assign next steps. Before lunch I handle rep
          coaching, escalations, and deal desk approvals. Afternoons are reserved for client
          calls, QBR prep, and recruiting screens. I end the day by updating the forecast and
          sending a short notes summary to the leadership channel.
      - question: What recurring meetings do you attend?
        answer: >
          I run the Monday sales huddle at 9:30 AM, the Wednesday branch update at 3 PM, and
          a Friday forecast review with finance. Monthly I host a pipeline scrub with Sales
          Ops and a customer advisory call for our top accounts.
      - question: What teams or tools do you rely on?
        answer: >
          Sales Operations for territory and quota, Customer Service for post-sale quality,
          and Marketing for top-of-funnel. I rely on our CRM (pipeline, forecasts, activity
          logs), the quoting tool for discount approvals, and Finance dashboards for revenue
          pacing and mix.
      - question: How do you measure success for your team?
        answer: >
          Revenue vs plan, weighted pipeline coverage (3x for the next quarter), win rate by
          segment, average cycle time, stage-by-stage conversion, and new logo adds. I also
          track coaching health (1:1 completion rate), forecast accuracy (within 5%), and
          customer retention for top accounts.
      - question: If someone needs a quick decision from you, what is the best way to reach you?
        answer: >
          Slack first, then a quick desk pop-in. For approvals, attach the context and link
          the CRM opportunity. If I’m in a meeting, use the “Needs-Approval” channel with a
          clear yes/no ask and deadline.
      - question: What are the top risks to hitting quota this quarter?
        answer: >
          Concentration risk in two large renewals, longer-than-expected cycles in public
          sector, and discount pressure from a new competitor. We are mitigating through
          early exec alignment, proof-of-value pilots, and strict discount guardrails.
      - question: What discount approval thresholds do you use?
        answer: >
          Reps can approve up to 10% with a justified note. 11–20% needs my approval with a
          competing quote attached. Over 20% requires Finance sign-off and a give-get list
          (multi-year, prepay, volume). No custom terms without Legal.
      - question: What does your sales process look like stage-by-stage?
        answer: |
          - Stage 1: Discovery — MEDDICC light fields required, next meeting booked
          - Stage 2: Solution Fit — demo completed, mutual success plan drafted
          - Stage 3: Proposal — pricing shared, redlines started if needed
          - Stage 4: Commit — verbal yes, paper in flight, target close date set
          - Closed Won/Lost — win/loss reason captured with 3 bullet specifics
      - question: Where do handoffs commonly fail?
        answer: >
          Missed context during the Sales to CS transition. We now require attaching the
          mutual success plan and confirming owner/backup in the handoff checklist.
      - question: What documentation do you rely on and where is it stored?
        answer: >
          Process wiki in the company knowledge base, deal desk SOPs in Google Drive, and
          dashboards embedded in the CRM home. I expect pages updated monthly by the owner.
      - question: What would make your job easier next quarter?
        answer: >
          Better lead scoring from Marketing, automated discount guardrails in the quoting
          tool, and a tighter weekly forecast discipline anchored on exit criteria.

  - name: Jim Halpert
    role: Account Executive
    team: Sales
    location: Scranton Branch
    qa:
      - question: What are your primary responsibilities?
        answer: >
          I manage a book of mid-market clients, handle renewals and upsells, prospect new
          regional accounts, and drive opportunities from discovery to close using our
          standard playbooks.
      - question: Which projects are you focused on right now?
        answer: >
          A cross-sell campaign for sustainable paper products, a referral workflow pilot
          with Marketing, and tightening proposal SLAs to 24 hours for in-cycle deals.
      - question: Describe your day-to-day workflow.
        answer: >
          Mornings are for prospecting and email follow-ups; mid-day I run demos and
          proposal reviews; late afternoons I prepare quotes, update the CRM, and confirm
          next steps with champions. Friday I send a concise weekly update to my manager.
      - question: What recurring meetings do you attend?
        answer: >
          Monday sales huddle, a Tuesday product enablement sync at 11 AM, and a Thursday
          account strategy session with my pod.
      - question: What teams or tools do you rely on?
        answer: >
          Sales Ops for pricing approvals, Customer Service for post-sale handoffs, and
          Marketing for campaigns. I live in the CRM, the quoting tool, and use email
          sequences and a dialer for outreach.
      - question: What does a great week look like?
        answer: |
          - 2 net-new meetings booked
          - 1 expansion opportunity progressed a stage
          - Proposal turnaround under 24 hours
          - Inbox at zero by Friday
      - question: How do you prepare for demos?
        answer: >
          I research the account, confirm the buyer roles, map pains to three product
          capabilities, and pre-build a short scenario using prospect data so the demo feels
          specific. I also prepare 3 discovery questions tied to value levers and a mutual
          next step.
      - question: Who is your ICP and what objections do you expect?
        answer: >
          Mid-market office managers and procurement leads. Objections: cost vs commodity,
          switching friction, and delivery reliability. I counter with total cost of
          ownership, white-glove onboarding, and on-time metrics with references.
      - question: What deal desk and discount rules do you follow?
        answer: >
          I can approve up to 10% with justification. Above that I attach the business case
          and competing quote, then route for manager approval. I avoid discounting unless I
          get a give-get like multi-year, volume, or reference.
      - question: What exit criteria do you use by stage?
        answer: |
          - Discovery: champion identified, pain quantified, next meeting set
          - Fit: problem-solution alignment documented, success metrics defined
          - Proposal: pricing shared, legal/terms owner identified
          - Commit: verbal yes, redlines in motion, target close date confirmed
      - question: What data must be in the CRM before you move a stage?
        answer: >
          MEDDICC light fields, primary contact, buying committee roles, next step with
          date, and a mutual success plan link at Proposal and beyond.

      - question: What market do we operate in and how is it changing?
        answer: >
          Dunder Mifflin serves the North American office paper and supplies market,
          focused on SMB and mid-market buyers who value service and reliability over
          pure price. Secular decline in copy paper is offset by growth in specialty
          papers, packaging materials, and sustainability-certified SKUs. Our moat is
          regional service, relationship sales, and on-time delivery.
      - question: Who are our customers and ideal segments?
        answer: >
          Core customers are office managers, procurement leads, and operations teams at
          50–1,000 employee companies. Ideal segments are professional services, education,
          healthcare clinics, and light manufacturing with recurring usage and multi-site
          needs. Buying committee typically includes an office manager (user), procurement
          (economic), and a department lead (sponsor).
      - question: What are corporate priorities this fiscal year?
        answer: |
          1. Mix shift: +8% of revenue from higher-margin specialty and sustainable SKUs

          3. Delivery excellence: on-time-in-full (OTIF) ≥ 97% across regions
          4. New logos: expand mid-market presence in education and healthcare
      - question: What KPIs do we track at the business level?

          - Net revenue retention (NRR) and churn rate
