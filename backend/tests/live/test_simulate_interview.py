"""
Integration test for the simulate interview functionality.

Tests both individual employee simulation and business-wide simulation:
1. Create business with employees and questions
2. Test individual employee simulation (/simulate/{employee_id})
3. Test business-wide simulation (/simulate/)
4. Verify simulation results and interview completion

This test hits real endpoints and may use real LLM calls.
