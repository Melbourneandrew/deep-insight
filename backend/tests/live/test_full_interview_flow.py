"""
Long-running integration test for the complete interview flow.

Tests the entire process:
1. Create business
2. Add three base questions  
3. Add employee
4. Start interview
5. Conduct full interview (3 base questions + 2 AI-generated follow-ups each = 9 total)
6. Verify interview completion

This test hits real endpoints and may use real LLM calls.
Expected flow: base -> follow-up -> follow-up -> base -> follow-up -> follow-up -> base -> follow-up -> follow-up
