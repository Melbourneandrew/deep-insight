"""
Long-running integration test for the complete interview flow.

Tests the entire process:
1. Create business
2. Add two questions  
3. Add employee
4. Start interview
5. Conduct full 6-question interview (2 base + 4 AI-generated follow-ups)
6. Verify interview completion

This test hits real endpoints and may use real LLM calls.
