from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to http://localhost
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = deep_insight_client.Configuration(

)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with deep_insight_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = deep_insight_client.BusinessesApi(api_client)
    business = deep_insight_client.Business() # Business | 

    try:
        # Create Business
        api_response = api_instance.create_business_businesses_post(business)
